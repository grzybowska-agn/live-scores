# Live-scores

### Known issues

1. Label, input and button html elements should be swapped with newly created components (atoms), co they can be reused if the app scale up.
2. Scss variables should be placed in a separate file and their values should be aligned with design decisions.
3. Form validation could be implemented if needed.
